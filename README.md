# User Manual:

Santa Helper is an interface to ChatGPT 4omini that exists to help the Santa in each of us, as we prepare for the holiday season. Our problem is to find interesting and relevant gift ideas based off of user provided information about a recipients demographics, interests, and hobbies. Calling ChatGPT itself to perform this fails in that it does not adequately create a personality that it is giving to, and thus gives bad gift ideas.

Our success criteria is that Santa Helper should be able to take information about a gift recipient (age, gender, hobbies, interests, and shared experiences) and respond with gift ideas that are relevant, fun, and thoughtful, so as to inspire the user Santa to give the best gifts possible.
